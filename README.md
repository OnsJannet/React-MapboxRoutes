# React-MapboxRoutes

React-MapboxRoutes is web application that allows users to calculate the cost of driving between multiple locations. The application uses the Mapbox API to generate a map that displays the route between the selected locations and provides the driving distance and time.

The project also includes a feature to calculate the fuel cost based on the distance and fuel consumption rate. The fuel price can be set manually by the user. Additionally, the project calculates the shopping time based on the number of locations and items to purchase, assuming 50 items to be purchased.

The application is built using the Mapbox GL JS library, which provides a powerful set of tools for creating interactive, customizable maps. The code uses event listeners to detect user input and respond dynamically to changes in the map or route.

The project is designed to be easily customizable and extendable, with the ability to add new features or modify existing ones to meet specific needs.
